## Customization

The scope of customization includes replacing text in the document related to the specific parameters of the project party.
This project has set project specific parameters as environment variable control, so all you need to do is to modify the environment variable value.

Here are the steps:
1. Direct to `pages/index.mdx` to fill in your own project information;
2. Direct to `.env` to modify the environment value.
3. Direct to `_meta.json` to add the links to your own website, explorer and rollup-info page.
