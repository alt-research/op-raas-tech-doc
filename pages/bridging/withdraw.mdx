# Withdraw from <EnvText envKey="networkName"/>

Bridging assets from <EnvText envKey="networkName"/> takes around **7 days**.

To bridge funds from <EnvText envKey="networkName"/> you can use our Bridge (<EnvLink envKey="bridgeWithdrawUrlMainnet">Mainnet</EnvLink> / <EnvLink envKey="bridgeWithdrawUrlTestnet">Testnet</EnvLink>). The whole process requires two steps, the two-step withdrawal process is designed to ensure the safety and integrity of cross-chain transactions.

## Step 1: Initiate withdrawal

First, Connect your wallet ([Mainnet](../using_mainnet) / [Testnet](../using_testnet)) to the <EnvText envKey="networkName"/> to the <EnvText envKey="projectName"/> Bridge. Make sure you've already switched the network to <EnvText envKey="networkName"/>.

Then, fill in the amount of <EnvText envKey="symbolMainnet"/> that you want to bridge. Ensure you have a positive balance of <EnvText envKey="symbolMainnet"/> on the <EnvText envKey="networkName"/>.

Click on **Withdraw** and wait for the transaction to go through.

Click on **Withdrawn**, it will jump to <EnvLink envKey="l2Explorer">transaction detials page</EnvLink>.

### Understand the individual status of withdrawals

#### Stage 1:  Waiting for state root to be published
State root is a cryptographic commitment to the entire state of the L2 system at a specific block height. This root is then published to the L1 blockchain, where it is secured by L1's consensus mechanism and can be challenged later.

#### Stage 2: Ready for prove


After waiting for the time displayed, your transaction should be on the stage of "Ready for prove".
Click on the **Prove** button and submit a transaction, this will turn to Stage 3.

#### Stage 3: Waiting for challenge period. 

[Challenge period](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/app-developers/bridging/messaging#understanding-the-challenge-period) is crucial for ensuring the integrity and security of the transactions. 
The challenge period may last for **7 days** in mainnet.

#### Stage 4: Finalise withdrawal

**7 days** later, the withdrawal is deemed valid and is finalized on the blockchain.
Click on **Finalize** in the transaction status page to complete the withdrawal finalization process.
