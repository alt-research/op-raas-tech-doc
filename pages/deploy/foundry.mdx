# Foundry

## What is Foundry?

[Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) is a toolset for Ethereum development written in Rust that assists developers in managing dependencies, compiling projects, running tests, deploying contracts, and interacting with blockchains through the command line interface.

Additionally, Foundry can directly communicate with Xterio Chain's Ethereum API, enabling the use of Foundry to deploy smart contracts into Xterio Chain.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have met the following conditions:

1. Have some tBNB on Xperio Testnet Network. You can follow our guide on [Bridging for Xterio Chain](https://whitelabel-raas-docs-release-vercel-xterio.vercel.app/bridging).
2. Rust must be installed on your computer. If it's not, [follow this guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).
3. Foundry must be installed on your computer. If it’s not, [follow this guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).


## Getting started
       
1. Create a project
   
   Forge is the command-line interface (CLI) tool for Foundry, allowing developers to execute operations directly from the terminal.

    ```
    forge init my-project
    ```
    
2. Install OpenZeppelin contracts as a dependency
    ```
    forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
    ```

3. Navigate to the Source in the project and create your smart contracts
    ```
    cd src
    touch MyToken.sol
    ```
4. Input your smart contract or use the sample contract below.
    ```
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
    
    import "lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

    contract MyERC20 is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {}
    }
    ```
    
    It's just a simple ERC20 token named "MyToken" with the symbol "MTK". You can change the token name and also write any other contracts. Just for notice if your file name is called differently, the commands to deploy will be slightly different. 

5. Compile contract
    ```
    forge build
    ```

## Deploying Your Smart contract

Deploying a contract with Forge is a simple process that can be done with a single command. However, it requires an RPC endpoint, a private key that has funds, and any arguments for the constructor of the contract.

For example, the `MyToken.sol` contract requires an initial supply of tokens to be specified in its constructor, so the command to deploy it on a network will include the argument of 100.


> **Notice：**
>
> Always keep your private key confidential and secure. Exposing it publicly can allow unauthorized access, giving full control to anyone who possesses it.



To deploy the `MyToken.sol` contract, use the command that corresponds to Xterio Chain's RPC URL while running the `forge create` command:

```
forge create --rpc-url "https://xterio.alt.technology"
--constructor-args 100 \
--private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY \
src/MyToken.sol:MyToken 
```

In the output you should get something like:

```
[⠢] Compiling... No files changed, compilation skipped 
Deployer: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266

```
The "Deployed to" value is your contract address.
